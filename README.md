Newbie Here Learning 
Hi, I'm Sharah. 26, from the Philippines. Due to this pandemic, I'm reminded of keeping up with learning to code; a goal I've been putting off for a long while. Here I am, back at day one of #100DaysOfCode challenge.I was afraid of learning how to use Github because it felt like I'm doing something for advance developers. LOL I was wrong.
